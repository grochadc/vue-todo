# My very own Vuejs Demos

I made this demos to have some practice as I follow the oficial Vuejs 2 [guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/).

On the folder `todo` you can find a simple TODO app with backend support with [jsonstore.io](https://github.com/bluzi/jsonstore).

On the folder `upvote` you can find a simple upvote downvote system demo.
